Dashboard Layouts
=================

Building something from scratch? These vanilla dashboard layouts will get you up and running in no time.

Our goal for these assets is to be as helpful and familiar as possible, without getting in your way. To that end, these layouts are composed of a minimal set of CSS styles on top of [Bootstrap v3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/), covering the most common layout configurations we've encountered so far.

Have a suggestion or a new layout to propose? Shoot us an [email](mailto:contact@keen.io), or even a pull request! Contributions are 1100% welcome!

**Note:** we've used [holder.js](https://github.com/imsky/holder) for labeled cell placeholders, which can be safely removed as you make these layouts your own.
